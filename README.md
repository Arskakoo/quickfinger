# Quick Finger 🔥

Quick finger is a game where you have to click the button that has changed color as quickly as possible. The game also teaches how to use the ten-finger system, as the player has to look at the screen at the same time as pressing the right button. The game is very simple, but even more addictive. 


## ⚠️ Warning ⚠️
### You can't play on anything other than PC!!!
The game is made with a Fin/Swe keyboard layout, so not all keys are necessarily in the right places. Will be fixed in the future 🔜
